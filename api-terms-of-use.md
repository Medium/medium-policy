# Medium API Terms of Use

Hello and welcome! If you’re reading this, chances are you’re interested in developing software for use with our application programming interface (“Medium API”). We’re glad you’re here and can’t wait to see what you come up with. Here are the terms of use our API.

**Do I have to agree to these terms of use?** If you want to use the API, yes. We’re offering use of the API only on the terms posted on this page. By using the Medium API, you’re agreeing to follow them. So, if you don’t agree to any of the terms, Medium does not grant you a license to use the API.

**For how long can I use the API?** Your license to the Medium API continues until it is ended by you or Medium.

**How would the license end?** Either party can end the license any time for any or no reason. If you want to end the license, just stop using the Medium API. That will end the license. If you violate any of the terms below, your license to use the API terminates automatically and right away. If Medium sends you a written notice terminating your license, that also terminates your license right away.

**How can I stay up to date on the terms?** We might update these terms from time to time. But we’ll keep up-to-date terms at this URL and save each version on GitHub.

1. **Licensed Uses and Restrictions.**

Medium owns the Medium API. Medium licenses it to you on these terms.

* You can use it anywhere in the world.
* Your use is non-exclusive, so others can use it too.

Medium hosts user generated content (“UGC”) such as text or images. UGC is owned by the users (or someone who allowed them to use is) and not by Medium. You agree to use UGC only in ways authorized by the user who posted it, such as providing attribution or otherwise complying with Creative Commons licenses.

Here are things you can’t do:

* Sell, lease, or sublicense the Medium API or access to it.
* Derive revenue (direct or indirect) from the using or providing the Medium API.
* Use the Medium API for any application that substantially replaces the core user experience of Medium’s website or apps.
* Do anything that could mislead users into thinking you are offering a replacement for Medium or that you or your product are endorsed or create by Medium.
* Use the Medium API to spam or harass anyone.
* Participate in any “follow” or “recommend” exchange program.
* Use the Medium API to post automatically generated content to Medium, including posts, follows, recommends, or responses not initiated by a Medium user.
* Conceal your identity or your application’s identity when requesting authorization to use the Medium API.
* Cache or store any UGC or user data except for the reasonable period necessary to provide your service.
* Use the Medium API for any application that is itself spyware, adware, or any other malicious software, or is used in connection with any such software.
* Use the Medium API in a way that violates the law or any person’s rights, including intellectual property and privacy rights.
* Use Medium as a generic image hosting service for banner advertisements, graphics, or similar.
* Use the Medium API in a way that undermines the stability of Medium’s servers or the behavior of other applications using the Medium API. Medium may rate limit or block applications that make a large number of calls to the API that are not primarily in response to direct user actions

By accepting these terms, you agree to comply with the [Medium Terms of Service](https://medium.com/policy/medium-terms-of-service-9db0094a1e0f). Medium reserves all rights not expressly granted in these terms.

2. **Trademark.**

You may use the Medium word mark or logo in connection with the Medium API as approved by Medium. You agree to seek prior approval in writing from Medium before any use of Medium’s logo or word mark.

3. **Relationship of the Parties.**

Medium has certain rights in the API under the laws of the U.S. and other countries. Medium’s rights apply to the Medium API and all its output and executables. You agree to abide by all applicable proprietary rights laws.

These terms don’t implicitly grant you rights in any intellectual property owned or licensed by Medium. The only such rights you receive under these Terms are those explicitly granted.

4. **Support.**

Medium may choose to provide you with support or modifications for the Medium API in its sole discretion. Medium may change, suspend, or discontinue any aspect of the Medium API, including such support or modifications, at any time without notice or liability.

5. **Fees.**

Medium is currently providing you the API for free.

6. **Disclaimer of Warranty.**

Medium’s providing the API to you as is. That means it doesn’t come with any warranty, express or implied. No implied warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, availability, security, title or non-infringement.

We’ve made this API as reliable as possible. But the Medium API probably won’t be perfect. So, we’re telling you now, it might have bugs, inaccuracies or interruptions.

You use the Medium API at your own discretion and risk.

7. **Limitation of Liability.**

Medium won’t be liable to you for any damages that arise from using the API. This includes all of types of damages (indirect, incidental, consequential, special or exemplary). And it includes all kinds of legal claims, such as breach of contract, breach of warranty, tort, or any other pecuniary loss.

8. **Release and Waiver.**

You release and waive all claims against Medium to the maximum extent permitted by law. This means all types of claims, damages, costs and expenses arising from your use of the Medium API. This includes all claims against any of Medium’s subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, licensors, co-branders or other partners, and employees.

If you’re a California resident, you waive your rights under California Civil Code 1542, which says: _“A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor.”_

You understand that you or Medium might later find out that a fact relating to this release is different than what we now believe. You accept and assume the risk of such possible differences in fact.

You expressly waive all rights and benefits you may have under any other source of law of similar effect, to the fullest extent permitted by law.

9. **Indemnity.**

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to indemnify Medium any third-party claim arising from or related to your use of the Medium API. This indemnity obligation to Medium includes Medium’s subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, licensors, co-branders or other partners, and employees. This indemnity obligation includes any liability or expense arising from all claims, losses, damages (actual and/or consequential), suits, judgments, litigation costs and attorneys’ fees. Medium will work in good faith to give you written notice of any such claim.

10. **General Terms.**

10.1 **Relationship of the Parties.** You and Medium are acting independently of each other. Neither will act as partner, joint venturer, agent, employee or employer of the other. You won’t have any express or implied authority to create or assume any obligation for Medium or on behalf of it.

10.2 **Severability.** If any provision of these terms is found invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, You and Medium agree that the court should try to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision and that other provisions of these will remain in full effect.

10.3 **Forum and Choice of Law.** These terms are governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of law provisions. You and Medium agree that any suit arising from these terms must take place in a court located in San Francisco, California.

10.4 **No Waiver of Rights.** If Medium doesn’t exercise any right it has under these terms, any such inaction doesn’t waive the applicable right or provision.

10.5 **Interpretation.** These terms may not be construed against either party.

10.6 **Entire Agreement.** These terms are the entire agreement between Medium and you concerning Medium’s API.
